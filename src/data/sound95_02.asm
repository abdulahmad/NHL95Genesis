; $07E0E0  Adapted from sound94.asm: the 94 Z80 program
;	NHL 95 segment $7E0E0-$7E36B, from lst/nhl95.bin.lst (IDA dc.b, no label). The 94 Z80 program (93 / 94 Z80_Program_Code), still
;	loaded by p_initialZ80 (sound95_01, no caller in 95). The same bytes as 94 except the bank window address of the FM patches, which 95
;	keeps at the end of sound95_01. The tail of the old placeholder ($7E36C-$7E4D5, 94 Pausemode) is split out as hockey95_02.

Z80_Program_Code	;First byte of the Z80 program (movea.l in p_initialZ80); the rest is the 94 Z80 driver. p_initialZ80 copies $295
	;bytes from here (through $7E374, into hockey95_02 in 95; 94 read into pcm_sample_table)
