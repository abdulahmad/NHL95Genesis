;
;	Top level of the full NHL 95 ROM build (build95.bat, npm run build:retail). The listing is output\nhl95 .lst.
;	The includes are in 95 ROM order, from the fingerprint map tools/segmap95.json (tools/fingerprint_map.py).
;	The address on each include line is the mapped lst/nhl95.bin start. It is provisional until the segment matches.
;	The org for a segment build goes in its _stub.asm. Do not put an org in a file this list includes: this file sets org 0.
;	ram95.asm (the RAM map), stubinc\ports.inc and stubinc\equals.inc are equates only, so they come first.
;
	include	stubinc\ports.inc	;IO_* / VDP_* ports. Equates only
	include	stubinc\equals.inc	;VDP status bits. Equates only
	include	ram95.asm		;RAM map. Equates only

	org	0			;the ROM starts at 0. Without an org SNASM writes a short, misaligned bin (the stubs carry their own org)
