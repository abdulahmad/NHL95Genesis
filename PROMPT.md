# Segment prompt

Paste this into a new Copilot Agent session. Opus 5.5, High. One segment only. Run it again for the next file. Do not edit this prompt.

```text
Read SEGMENT_AGENT.md before you write any asm. It is the queue. Take the first file in the ROM map that is not marked matched. That file is the only segment this session. Do not start the file after it.

Open the listing before you write any asm. It is already in the repo:

lst/nhl95.bin.lst

Search it for the start label named in SEGMENT_AGENT.md. The listing has no address column. loc_ and sub_ names are the address. If it does not open, stop and say the path you tried.

Do not disassemble lst/nhl95.bin. Do not write a disassembler. Do not edit nhl95.asm except to put the confirmed org on this file's include line. Do not delete an asm file. Edit the segment file in place. Do not rewrite SEGMENT_AGENT.md as a whole file. Edit the current row in place. Do not append a history entry.

Follow the rules already in SEGMENT_AGENT.md. The reference ROM is lst/nhl95.bin. Style source is the matching file in https://github.com/abdulahmad/NHL94Genesis. Use https://github.com/abdulahmad/NHLPA93Genesis only when 94 does not have the routine.

The placeholder files are not a confirmed split. Before writing asm, open the matching 94 file and find the routine this 95 range corresponds to. The 95 start and end come from lst/nhl95.bin.lst, not from the 94 org. If this placeholder covers more than one 94 file, split it and add the new include to nhl95.asm in ROM order. If 95 has a system 94 does not have, add a file and an include. If 95 has no matching code, drop the placeholder and its include. Do not leave an empty file in the include list.

1. ram95 is not a queue segment. It has no ROM bytes to verify. If SEGMENT_AGENT.md names it as the current segment, move past it and take the next row. RAM is not off limits: add each new RAM name to src/ram95.asm, the RAM map the full build and every stub include, as you transcribe code segments that use it. Define each name once.
2. For ROM segments: write or reuse src/<file>_stub.asm at the confirmed org. Include stubinc\ports.inc, stubinc\equals.inc, ram95.asm, and the segment file (data\<file>.asm for a pure data file). Do not put an org in the file nhl95.asm includes.
3. Point package.json build:seg and verify:seg at that file and org. Add seg:<file>: buildseg.bat, then fixopcodes.js on "output\<file> .lst" and output\<file>.bin, then verifySegment.js <file> <org> lst/nhl95.bin. The assembler listing name has a space before .lst.
4. Transcribe the listing for the confirmed range. Write real cmp / cmpi / exg. fixopcodes.js rewrites an EA cmp.l only. A real cmpi.l stays 0C80. Take every outside stub address from the branch displacement in lst/nhl95.bin.
5. Run npm.cmd run seg:<file>. MATCH must cover the confirmed range and must not be 0 bytes. Then add comments and run it again.
6. In SEGMENT_AGENT.md, mark that file matched with the byte count and range. Set Current segment to the next unmatched file. Do not mark the next file matched.

Stop after 5 failed verifies. Report the file, the first address, the built byte, the retail byte, and the instruction you emitted. Do not continue.
